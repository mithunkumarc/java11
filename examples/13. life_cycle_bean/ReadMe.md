> In Spring framework, we can manage lifecycle of a bean by using method-level annotations @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy.

> The @PostConstruct annotation is used on a method that needs to be executed after dependency injection is done to 
perform any initialization.

> The @PreDestroy annotation is used on methods as a callback notification to signal that the instance is in the 
process of being removed by the container.
