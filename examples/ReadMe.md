what is spring boot : 

      "Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications 
      that you can just run"

      
    stand-alone – 
    
    Spring Boot, by default supports a variety of embedded web servers which runs inside the application. 
    This eliminates the need of deployment of any war files. 
    It is important to understand that here the word "stand-alone" does not mean Java standard application.
    
    production-grade – 
    Spring Boot applications are high quality and can be deployed to production as is.
    
    just run – 
    Spring Boot applications can be simply run using the main function OR using the java –jar command. 
    There is no need to deploy it to external web servers - though we are free to do so if needed.
