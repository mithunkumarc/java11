BDD : considers scenarios 

BDD steps : 

1. Given : create stub 
2. When : actual mehtod call/under test (Don't confuse with mockito's when with BDD's When)
3. Then : verify / assert

Note : Given and When both can be used to create stub, but if would be readable if we use Given to create stubs to match BDD steps.
