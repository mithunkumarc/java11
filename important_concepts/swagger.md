### swagger is a tool used as documentation format for Restful services

__Swagger makes documenting your RESTful services much easier.__  
__consuer (who uses services) may want to know like__  
__what are the contract of server__  
__what will be the response format__  
__what will be the request format__  


        Your clients will need to know how to interact with your API. 
        In SOAP based web services, you had a WSDL to work with. This gave API developers a XML based contract, 
        which defined the API. 
        However, with RESTFul web services, there is no WSDL. Thus your API documentation becomes more critical.
